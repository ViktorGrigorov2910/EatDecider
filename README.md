# EatDecider 

My first Jetpack Compose Android Application.

One screen with 3-4 composables:

You have some places where you can eat, you press a button and you get a randomly selected place. The place is automatically saved in a local database (using Room). You also have a history that keeps track what day of the week and where you went to eat.

Pretty simple ðŸ› ðŸ› ðŸ›
